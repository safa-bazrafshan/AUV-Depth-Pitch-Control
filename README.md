# AUV Control Systems Project

This repository contains a progressive exploration of control strategies for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs), implemented and simulated in MATLAB. The project is divided into four main phases, each demonstrating increasing complexity and control robustness.

---

## 📌 Phase 1: Classical PID Controller

- Implemented basic depth control using a PID controller.
- Simulations were performed with and without external disturbances (e.g., water currents).
- Stability, response time, and disturbance rejection were evaluated.

## 📌 Phase 2: Sliding Mode Control (SMC)

- Introduced SMC for robust nonlinear control under uncertain dynamics.
- Compared system performance to PID control.
- Simulated system behavior under disturbance conditions.

## 📌 Phase 3: Full-State Nonlinear Modeling + LQR

- Developed a full nonlinear model of the AUV including pitch, yaw, and depth dynamics.
- Designed and implemented an LQR controller for state feedback.
- Analyzed the system’s multi-axis behavior and control effectiveness.

## 📌 Phase 4: Fuzzy Logic Controller

- Implemented a fuzzy logic controller for depth regulation.
- Explored intelligent control approaches for smoother, adaptive performance.
- Focused on mimicking human decision-making under nonlinearity and uncertainty.
